## Introduction

Predicting the price of cars is essential for both buyers and sellers. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a car price prediction model, helping users estimate the selling price of a car based on its characteristics.

## Data Collection

We start by collecting data from a CSV file (`car_data.csv`) using the Pandas library. This dataset contains information about various cars, including features like Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning. In this project, we:
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Encode categorical data into numerical form for machine learning models.
- Split the dataset into training and test data using scikit-learn's `train_test_split`.

## Model Training

We train two regression models in this project: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
- Linear Regression is a basic regression technique used to predict numeric values.
- Lasso Regression is a variant of linear regression that performs well when variables are not directly proportional.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate our models using the R-squared (RÂ²) error metric, a measure of how well the model fits the data.
- We visualize actual vs. predicted prices to understand the model's performance.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn) installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.
4. Use the trained models to predict car prices.
